# OpenDMS
We are a dedicated team of software engineers who share a deep appreciation for Open Dental. Our goal is to keep it truly open and accessible to everyone.

To ensure its continued availability and evolution, we’ve decided to fork the open-source version 24.3 and take an active role in managing the community.

We welcome developers, dental professionals, and enthusiasts to contribute and help shape the future of this project.

We’re calling it OpenDMS.io—a name that reflects both our commitment to openness and our focus on Dental Management Systems.

Our roadmap will be community-driven, with features prioritized based on real-world needs. Stay tuned for updates as we build a future where great dental software remains free, flexible, and powerful for all.
